I build new defi primitives on Arbitrum.

## Technologies

The following are ordered by frequency of use. I strive to be a generalist, and generally
speaking, in my development lifestyle (and life in general) I try to maintain an empty
head. The following is provided to reflect my recent experience.

### Programming languages

1. Go
2. OCaml
3. Rust
4. 9rc, Bash, shell scripting languages, etc
5. Python
6. Solidity, Vyper, Huff
7. KDB+ Q
8. Typescript/Javascript

### Operating systems

2. OpenBSD
3. MacOS

## Open source projects

Most of my work is available at @fluidity-money. I also work on [Stylus
Saturdays](https://stylussaturdays.substack.com/), though at the time of writing, this is
overdue for another entry.

## Friends

I collaborate closely with [Shahmeer Chaudhry](https://x.com/shahmeerx), [Ivan Seara
Nunes](https://x.com/IvanSN_), and Erik (cibo6).

## Contact

The best way to reach me is via email or by using one of my friends as a filter. If you're
disclosing a security vulnerability (or something that I should perhaps know urgently), my
advice is to contact me through one of our forms. If you must let me know urgently, get in touch
via Telegram at [@doggish](https://t.me/doggish).

Please don't email me about exchange listing offers.
