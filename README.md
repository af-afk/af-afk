I build new defi primitives on Arbitrum.

## Technologies

The following are ordered by frequency of use. I strive to be a generalist, and generally
speaking, in my development lifestyle (and life in general) I try to maintain an empty
head. The following is provided to reflect my recent experience.

### Programming languages

1. Go
2. OCaml
3. Rust
4. 9rc, Bash, shell scripting languages, etc
5. Python
6. Solidity, Vyper, Huff
7. KDB+ Q
8. Typescript/Javascript

### Operating systems

1. Debian and derivatives
2. OpenBSD
3. MacOS

## Talks/organisations/writings

I co-founded and am the CTO of [Fluidity Labs](https://fluiditylabs.io) (this is
intentionally a low-code site for the record), which builds
[Superposition](https://superposition.so) (and its plethora of apps) and [Fluidity
Money](https://fluidity.money). I founded [Adelaide Functional
Programming](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/adelaide-functional-programming-meetup-group/),
though I've taken a step back from ongoing management since November 2024. I started
[Stylus Saturdays](https://stylussaturdays.substack.com/), a blog focusing on developments
in the Arbitrum Stylus ecosystem. I founded ages ago [Iomete Labs](https://iometelabs.io)
(Esperanto word for "small"), a software development company which built software for
local Adelaide companies, and, at the time, explained ZK concepts with a blog/newsletter
format. For each of these orgs I've given talks, some of which can be found on the
internet around places. These include how to build orderbooks with functional programming,
how to use genetic programming with combinators to solve optimisation problems, and most
recently how to build a lending protocol stablecoin. I've written some insane ramblings at
[Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/bayge.eth), including how to implement a DAO based on
futarchy/prediction market concepts.

Most of these organisations reflect my "code is free speech" philosophy, and are as such
open source and MIT licensed (with the exception of Fluidity's monorepo app). Fluidity
Labs lives at [its Github](https://github.com/fluidity-money), and it contains the bulk of
my work.

## Friends

I collaborate closely with [Shahmeer Chaudhry](https://x.com/shahmeerx), [Ivan Seara
Nunes](https://x.com/IvanSN_), and my longtime Iomete Labs collaborator, Erik/cibo6.
